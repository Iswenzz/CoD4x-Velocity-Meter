This program calculates the active player's velocity in real time, and displays it to the application window. Velocity is calculated by using the following formula:

To explain this a bit: The image above is the geometrical formula for distance between 2 points. We store this value in a class property, and update it every 50 milliseconds, therefore giving us Velocity, which is measured in distance per time.
